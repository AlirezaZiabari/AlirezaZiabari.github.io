My name is Alireza Ziabari. I am a third year CS Ph.D. student at University of Southern California, advised by [Morteza Dehghani](https://www.mola-lab.org/people). Currently, I am interested in enhancing NLP systems to have learning capabilities comparable to those of humans. This involves delving into innovative methods of adaptation through continual learning and learning from feedback via reinforcement learning.

Previously, I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked with [Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://sharif.edu/~rohban/index.html).
